### Objective
As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an A/B test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention and game rounds.

### Tools, libraries and techniques used

- VScode
- Python
- Bootstraping(for AB test)
- Numpy, matplotlib, pandas

### Conclusion
The results show that there is a 100% probability that 7-day retention is higher when the gate is at level 30 than when it is at level 40. If we want to keep the retention high both 1-day and 7-day retention- we should not move the gate from level 30 to level 40.
